Using our Yeoman Generator is the best and fastest way to get Kickoff each time you want to start a new project. It will ask you a few questions and then build a custom version of [Kickoff version 5](https://github.com/TryKickoff/kickoff/releases/tag/5.0.0) for your needs.

## What is Yeoman?
Yeoman helps you kickstart new projects, prescribing best practices and tools to help you stay productive. Yeoman is open-source but is maintained by a number of people from Google.

We have created a generator that once installed, allows you to create a custom build of Kickoff whenever you need.

## Installation

### Install Yeoman
If you haven't installed Yeoman yet, run this command in your terminal:

```shell
npm install -g yo
```

### Install the generator
To install generator-kickoff from npm, run:

```shell
npm install -g generator-kickoff
```

### Install them both :)
```shell
npm install -g yo generator-kickoff
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```shell
yo kickoff
```

## The Kickoff generator asks for this information:
1. Project name
1. Project description
1. What are the project developer's names?
1. Does this project support IE8?
1. Use Browserify?
1. Choose your javascript namespace (default is `KO`)
1. Which javascript libraries would you like to use? jQuery v1.x/2.x, trak.js, Swiftclick & Cookies are the options
1. Include Kickoff's styleguide?
1. Use Kickoff [Statix](/kickoff/statix/)?
1. Use Grunticon?
1. Include some default Javascript shims? (These are generated by the `grunt shimly` command)

The repo and more information can be found at [github.com/TryKickoff/generator-kickoff](https://github.com/TryKickoff/generator-kickoff)
