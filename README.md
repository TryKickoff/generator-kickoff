Using our Yeoman Generator is the best and fastest way to get Kickoff each time you want to start a new project. It will ask you a few questions and then build a custom version of [Kickoff version 5](https://github.com/TryKickoff/kickoff/releases/tag/5.0.0) for your needs.

## What is Yeoman?
Yeoman helps you kickstart new projects, prescribing best practices and tools to help you stay productive. Yeoman is open-source but is maintained by a number of people from Google.

We have created a generator that once installed, allows you to create a custom build of Kickoff whenever you need.

## Installation

### Install Yeoman
If you haven't installed Yeoman yet, run this command in your terminal:

```shell
npm install -g yo
```

### Install the generator
To install generator-kickoff from npm, run:

```shell
npm install -g generator-kickoff
```

### Install them both :)
```shell
npm install -g yo generator-kickoff
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```shell
yo kickoff
```
